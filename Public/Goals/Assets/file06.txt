6.
My life would look like very high-status male.
Someone who can accomplish what most people do not. 
From the moment I wake up to my beautiful; wife and give her a kiss.
I get up and make coffee to take in the view from are penthouse apartment.
I would than meditate for 1hr, then proceed to read the news and get ready for work.
By taking a shower, shave, and number 2. Start working on my tasks for the day.
At lunch I break my fast with a healthy balanced meal. Go to the gym for a great workout. 
Finish the day by exploring the city once my wife is free to try new foods and explore the city.
