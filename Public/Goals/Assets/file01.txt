1.
I want to learn coding so I can build apps and make projects that help make life easier. 
My motivations are a life of travel, working on my own schedule and ability to work remotely.
I will prove to myself I can stick to a habit and learn something new.
I well gain the skills to get a high paying career. 
What it means to me is having the ability to create.
